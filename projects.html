            <p class="projectHeader">Summary</p>
            <p>Part of a team that developed a windows-based desktop application for users to log and analyze tasks related data.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="projectHeader">Team</p>
        <p>Due to the small team size, it was more efficient for all team members to partake in development and design of the app versus assigning rigid roles.</p>
        <ul>
          <p>Team Members:</p>
          <li>Ethan Chen</li>
          <li>Brendan Grant</li>
          <li>Niko Kanoyan</li>
          <li>Kalvin Kouch</li>
          <li>Thomas Reynolds</li>
          <li>Pablo Rodriguez</li>
        </ul>  

        <p class="projectHeader">My Role</p>
        <p>Designed and Coordinated the building of the task logging app in an Agile based development environment within 6-8 weeks.</p>

        <p class="projectHeader">Coordination</p>
        <p>Split work on app by the app's pages (homepage, file creation page, etc.) to each members of the team so we could work in parallel.
        <br>Additionally, had weekly check-ins so team members could demonstrate progress, ask for advice, and evaluate progress towards completed app.</p>

        <p class="projectHeader">Reflection</p>
        <p>When team members are demonstrating progress on their assigned portion of the app, instead of just accepting answers like "oh, I am still in working on it..."
            use the time to discuss what directions that individual is planning on taking or has undertook to make progress. Otherwise, progress on that section of the app
            could get behidn and be rushed at the last minute.</p>
          
        <p>When someone is sick, make sure a backup developer has already been designated to take that person's spot.</p>

            <p class="projectHeader">Summary</p>
            <p>Worked with a partner to develop backend of a search engine for our IN4 141 Search Engine project capable of handling 55,000+ documents or
              webpages.</p>

        <p class="projectHeader">Index</p>
        <p>From a given document collection my partner and I designed our search engine to scrape tokens and stem them using Krovetz
           stemmer (due to speed and decent accuracy compared to Porter stemmer). Tokens are then stored in broken indexes (multiple
            text files) of generally 100-200MB each. Storing the tokens in one file would be too large. The data stored in each broken
             inverted index is a token followed by a list of docIDs (pointing a corresponding url) with that token's frequency, positions,
              and number of tokens that were titles, bolded, or headers in that given docID. After the broken indices are generated they
               are merged into a single merged inverted index and a separate reference index is kept which lists all discovered tokens and
                their memory locations in the merged index (to be used in hash table lookups when responding to queries).</p>
